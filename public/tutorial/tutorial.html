            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To begin, create an account on the login page. Then, create or join a league! 
                (You may need to reload the page to see it show up on your homepage.)
                You can share the League Name and Password with your friends so you can play against them.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="tutorial-step">
            <h2>Friendlies</h2>
            <p>
                Friendlies are games that are played before the tournament starts. 
                (Tournaments haven't been implemented yet, but you can play as many friendlies as
                you'd like.)
                You can play with
                your friends to get a sense of strategy for your own team, and learn about theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
                View the league you've joined by clicking the View button on the homepage. Along the right-hand
                side, you will see all of the teams in the league, including yours!
            </p>
            <p>
                To challenge another team, click the "Challenge" button by their team name.
                They will have to accept your challenge (done on the same page, by clicking the
                "Accept Challenge" button). Once accepted, both of you can "View Challenge".
            </p>

        <section class="tutorial-step">
            <h2>Preparing for a Game</h2>
            <p>Picklebrawl is all about team management. Choose players that work well together
                and put them on roles that they will excel in. Once your team is set, you have
                no control over how the match goes. The match will play on its own once both
                teams have locked in their players and strategy, and you don't even have to watch
                it happening live -- you can watch it after its over, whenever you have time to 
                log on!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on the "View Challenge" button next to a team where both of you have agreed to a challenge.</li>
                <li>
                    First, you will choose your players from your bench. You will not be able to 
                    see which players your opponent has chosen at this point, although you can see
                    their entire team and guess what choices they may make. Once you're confident
                    with your choices, press "Lock In Starters"!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Until both you and your opponent have locked in your starters, the 
                    person who locked in starters first will only see a greyed out bench with the 
                    option to undo their lock-in. Once both players lock in, there's no going 
                    back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are currently some bugs with these starters showing up, so you may need
                    to use the "Back" button on the upper-left hand corner of the page, then
                    press "View Challenge" again until the menus show as expected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second, once both challengers have locked in their starters, you will choose 
                    each starter's role. Each player has one role for
                    when your team is on offense and one role for when your team is on defense. 
                    More detail on these is given in the "Roles" section of the tutorial. At this
                    stage, you will be able to see the starters your opponent has picked. Once
                    you're done picking roles, press "Lock In Actions"!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Again, until both players have locked in their actions, the player who locked
                    in first will only see a greyed out menu with the option to undo their lock in.
                    If your opponent is already locked in, you will see "READY" in green under their
                    name on the action-picking menu.
                    Once both players lock in their actions, the final stage of the challenge happens!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="tutorial-step">
            <h2>Playing a Game</h2>
            <p>
                Once both players have locked in their players and actions, the game will play 
                itself. If you were on the action-picking menu when the game starts, it will 
                automatically show you the game -- otherwise you'll have to press "View Challenge"
                to watch the animation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The animation will show you a tick-by-tick play of how the game went, with visuals
                showing which team has possession, where it is on the field, and which players 
                currently have the ball. There is a running console log as well which helps you 
                keep track of which players did what during the game. 
            </p>

        <section class="tutorial-step"></section>
            <h2>Player Info/Stats</h2>
            <p>
                Each time you join a league, a team of 8 players is automatically generated for 
                you. Each of these players has unique names, stats, and quirks. When planning your 
                team, you can always mouse over any stat or quirk to see a brief description. 
                There are currently
                6 stats a player can have, each of which giving the player different strengths:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bulk: Players with high values take less damage when attacked and are better 
                    at defending advancement from the other team
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finesse: Players with high values are better at scoring and assisting other players
                </li>
                <li>
                    Height: Players with high values are better at defending scoring and 
                    protecting their teammates from attacks
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strength: Players with high values are better at advancing and attacking
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trickiness: This stat is tied to Focus. If this player is on offense 
                    (advancing or scoring) and they're being defended by a player with lower Focus
                    than this player's Trickiness, then this player has a chance to juke out the 
                    defender and advance/score as if they were not defended at all.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Focus: This stat is tied to Trickiness. If this player is on defense (defending 
                    advancing or scoring) and they're defending against a player with lower
                    Trickiness than this player's Focus, then this player has no chance of getting
                    juked out and always defends, lessening the chance of a large advance/successful
                    score.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each player also generates with a quirk. Learn about them as you play!
            </p>

        <section class="tutorial-step">
            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <p>
                There are some roles players can only have while they're playing offense, some 
                players can only have while they're playing defense, and some that are universal 
                which can be used regardless of whether the player is playing offense or defense. 
                Multiple players can have the same roles. When choosing roles for your starters, 
                if you hover the mouse over a role that has been selected for a player, a tooltip 
                will appear to describe what that role does.
            </p>

            <h4>Offensive Roles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Advance: This player will attempt to move towards the opponent's goal
                    once your team is in possession of the ball. This role is aided by high 
                    Strength.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Score: This player will attempt to score once your team has advanced close 
                    enough to the opponent's goal. This role is aided by high Finesse.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Defensive Roles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Defend Advance: This player will lessen the amount that opposing players are 
                    able to move towards your goal when your team doesn't have possession of the 
                    ball. This role is aided by high Bulk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Defend Score: This player will lessen the chances of an opposing Scorer making
                    a successful goal when they try to shoot. This role is aided by high Height.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Universal Roles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Attack: This player will attack a player on the opposing team. If successful,
                    the player who was attacked will have significantly lower stats depending on 
                    how much damage was done for a brief time. This role is aided by high Strength,
                    and players with high Bulk naturally take less damage from attacks. Note that
                    this feature is still being balanced!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Protect: This player will protect another player on your team from being 
                    attacked. If you have a star Scorer with very low Bulk, for example, giving
                    them a Protector might prevent the opposing team from attacking that Scorer
                    for huge amounts of damage and ruining your whole strategy. This role is aided 
                    by high Height.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assist: This player will help another player on your team, whatever their role 
                    is. This role is aided by Finesse. 
                    
                    This comes particularly in handy if you want two players on the same role, but
                    only one player with good stats for that role, e.g. you want two Advancers but only 
                    have one player with high Strength. In this case, if you have a player with high 
                    Finesse, you can have them assist the Advancer, and it will be almost as good as 
                    simply having two advancers. Furthermore, if you have no idea what starters your 
                    opponent might pick, choosing a starter with high Finesse allows you more 
                    flexibility when it comes to possible strategies you might pick during your 
                    choosing roles stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rest: This player will do nothing during the section of the game this role is 
                    picked for (offense or defense), but will become more effective at their role 
                    during the other section of the game.
                </li>
            </ul>
